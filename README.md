# Egg

## About
A dumb little site i made to test out CSS animations, using a Javascript colorpicker, dynamically changing the favicon, and some other stuff through JS. This site is not intended to be used or taken seriously.

### INSTRUCTIONS

[**Click here**](https://armel081.github.io/egg)</ins> if you want to view the site online through Github Pages, or if you prefer to download a local copy, go to to the <ins>[**Releases**](https://github.com/Armel081/egg/releases)</ins> page, download the latest version of the ``` egg-release.zip``` file, extract the ```egg-release``` folder, then click on ```index.html``` to get started on the main page. Also, don't touch anything else from the folder, as that may cause elements on the page to break and/or not load correctly.
